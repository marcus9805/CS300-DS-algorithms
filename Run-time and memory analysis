Run-time and memory analysis:

Cost per line:
Reading a line: O(1)
Parsing a line: O(1) (assuming split by commas is O(1))
Creating course objects and adding to data structures:
Vector: O(1) per insert
Hash Table: O(1) on average per insert
BST: O(log n) per insert in a balanced tree

Menu Display: O(1)
Search:
Vector: O(n) for linear search
Hash Table: O(1) on average for lookup
BST: O(log n) for search
Print All Courses 
Vector: O(n log n) for sort + O(n) for print => O(n log n)
Hash Table: O(n log n) for sort + O(n) for print => O(n log n)
BST: O(n) for in-order traversal and print
