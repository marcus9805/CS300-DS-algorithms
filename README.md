# CS300-DS-algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? - Developing a program that can read a file of course data and store it in a Binary Search Tree. The program the loads the data and prints the courses in alphanumeric order with prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. - The approach involved a binary search tree data structure. Understanding data structures is important because it is an efficient way to sort, search and manage data

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? - By debugging issues and thorough testing. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? - I have a much better understanding of how data structure work and their use cases.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? - By following best practices and utilizing destructors to clean up memory. Also utilizing in-line comments for improved readability.
